"Why am I seeing, hearing, feeling weird things?","If you are meditating and began to experience strange sensations/see or hear strange things like pretty colors, lights, images, voices, music, or experienced strange states of blankness, bliss, ecstasy, depression, sadness, confusion, immersion, fantasy, daydreaming, heaviness, lightness, etc. you may be a little concerned."
Why can't I sit still?,"There are a few approaches to this. You can power through it, make small changes to what you're doing to ease yourself into it, or choose a different meditation style that might make you feel less restless."
Why can't I stop my mind racing?,"That's OK. It's where most people start, and lots more end up back there at some point. Just keep doing what you're doing. After weeks or longer, you might start to see two things happen. First, it will start to quiet down on its own. Second, your relationship to the chatter will change so that it's not such a big deal. The boredom most people feel when starting out tends to go away with experience. The part of it that doesn't go away either becomes another object for meditation or fades into the background of so many other unimportant inputs that won't affect the core of your meditation. Either way, the drowsiness that comes from feeling like absolutely anything else would be more fun can also fade with time."
Why do I get drowsy or fall asleep?,"This could be posture related. If you're slouching, try sitting up straighter. If it's not comfortable to try sitting up straighter, try a meditation bench, zafu (meditation cushion), or if you don't want to spring for one of those, a rolled up towel or pillow."
Am I forcing my mind to do this?,"You will make faster progress if you don't worry too much about it. Just keep coming back to the focus of your meditation (beath/mantra etc). One day you may find yourself in the middle of a sit and realize that it's going exactly how you always wanted it to. That day probably won't be tomorrow, or the next day after that. Just let it happen when it will, and when it does, remember to not get attached to it. Whatever you think is a good sit, or bad sit, the technology is working away regardless."
Why do my back or legs hurt?,"t may be that that's just a sensation that you'll have to deal with according to the type of meditation you've chosen, or your body might really be telling you something is wrong."
Why can't I seem to get past x minutes?,"Keep at it. Your practice can feel stale independent of any progress you're actually making. Just relax into it. A common pitfall is to blame yourself for it. You have at least two options from here: you can try making that blame the object of your meditation for a little while, or you can go the other way and set your timer for shorter periods. The point either way is to help yourself realize that you're not doing anything wrong, so you can get back to the core of what you were doing. This is why we call it meditation ""practice""."
How long/often should I meditate?,"We recommend you should practice as often as charms you, but please make your practice regular to ensure reasonable progress. Beginners might start at 5 mins per session and build up from there. Experienced meditators may sit for hours at a time. For example, daily is good. Twice daily is better. The longer you leave it between sessions the more stress accumulates. Some experienced meditators sit twice a day at 20-30 mins per session, just after waking, and again after work is completed for the day. Other experienced meditators prefer a single sit of an hour per day.

It really is up to you. Follow what charms you and keep it realistic!"
How should I sit?,"If you are practicing a seated meditation, you should aim to sit in a comfortable position with your spine straight/erect.

If this is physically impossible, then meditate however you need to.

Some meditation styles will recommend a particular position, eyes open, half open, shut etc."
Can I meditate listening to music?,"As a beginner you may think you need music to meditate to. Meditation styles vary, but most effective traditional methods require the removal of external distractions."
Why am I experienced and going through a rough patch?,"Maybe you’ve been meditating for a while and thought you were making progress, but now feel worse - more disconnected, nihilistic, wondering why to keep going if everything is impermanent?

First of all, if you feel unable to cope with daily life, take actions outside of meditation to deal with it. Talk to a counselor, get psychiatric medication if you need it, and take care of yourself in every way that you can (talk to friends, get some exercise, eat well, get some sleep). Stop meditating if you think you need to. Above all, don't blame yourself for feeling this way. It is not unheard of and it is not because of something you did wrong.

Once you take whatever steps you need to get the basics of your life together, a good next step would be talking to a meditation teacher in real life. That's supposed to be a good idea at any stage of meditative practice, but especially now."
Why do I feel disconnected?,"If it's disconnection specifically that you're feeling without the other problems, try doing some metta meditation. It's easy and probably won't interfere with whatever other meditation you're practicing."
What's the best time to meditate?,We recommend meditating first thing in the morning if you can. It’s a nice way to start the day and is usually the easiest time to find a few undisturbed minutes. The most important thing is to pick a time that works for you and try to consistently meditate at that time.
How do I find time to meditate?,"Try to anchor your practice to another part of your routine, like brushing your teeth. Wake up and think: meditate, brush teeth, drink coffee. And don’t be frustrated if you miss a session. It happens. Just start right up again the next day."
Where should I meditate?,"No need to hike to the nearest mountaintop. Any reasonably quiet, comfortable place where you’re not likely to be interrupted is just fine."
What should I wear to meditate?,"You can wear whatever you like so long as you’re comfortable. It also helps to take off uncomfortable shoes and to loosen tight clothing, like ties or belts, if they’re bothering you. No skinny Jeans allowed."
"How do I sit during meditation?
","Sit in the middle of a chair with your legs uncrossed, feet flat on the floor and hands resting on the legs or on your lap. The important thing is to set your body up in a way that your muscles are able to switch off and relax."
Can I meditate lying down?,"We generally recommend sitting instead of lying down. However, if it’s too painful or uncomfortable to sit upright, you’re OK lying down. Try placing a thin pillow under your head and bending your knees so your feet are flat on the floor. It’ll help protect your lower back."
Is there a particular way I should breathe?,"Nope. When we meditate, we’re not trying to breathe in a special way. Just allow the breath to be completely natural."
How do I start meditating again after a break?,"It really depends on how long you’ve been away. If it’s only been a few days, just pick up right where you left off. If it’s been at least a week, we recommend restarting the pack. If it’s been more than a month, you should probably do the Basics pack and get comfortable meditating again before you jump into anything else."
How do I start?,"The best way to start is simply, and very small. Most of us get too caught up in doing things perfectly, in all the little details, and so we complicate things so much that we never get started. The most important detail is starting. So start very small: just 2 minutes a day, every day, in a fairly quiet space, first thing in the morning."
"What is the best hour to meditate (early in the morning, evening or any time)?","This is really an individual thing, as people’s schedules and preferences will vary widely. However, I love the morning, and highly recommend it for a few reasons. First, that’s often best because later in the day we get busy and things like exercise and meditation often get pushed back. Second, morning tends to be quieter for many people, and more ideal. Third, it’s an amazing way to start your day. That said, it can be done at any time. The evening, when things might also be quiet, could be great — and a nice way to unwind after a tough day.
"
How do you create the time when your day is already so busy?,"Again, start very small. Just 2 minutes. If you don’t have 2 minutes, do 1. You should be able to find 1-2 minutes a day. Do it in the morning, before you get busy. If you still can’t find the time, cut back on one commitment this month to make space for it — email someone and say you can’t do the project/commitment because you’re too busy. And trust me, if you can’t find 1-2 minutes each day for meditation, you’re too busy."
I have trouble with finding a set time and place every day.,"I highly recommend that you pick one time and place each day — that’s the best way to create a habit. Pick a trigger in your morning or evening routine — something that’s already in your daily routine. That might be things like waking, brushing your teeth, eating breakfast, drinking coffee, using the bathroom, eating dinner, arriving home, watching TV before bedtime, reading the newspaper, checking email, etc. Pick one of these things, and do the meditation habit for 5 minutes right after, without fail."
Length of time — how much time is the minimum for effective meditation? How often should I do it?,"Start with 2 minutes. Starting small is highly recommended for any new habit. As you gain traction, you can increase it little by little. This takes patience, but it’s very effective. I also recommend a daily habit, as opposed to twice a week, or just on weekdays."
How do you find the right space within what you have? What conditions should the environment have?,"Any space will do — clear some space on your floor, do it on your bed, or on your couch, in the middle of your kitchen. I prefer doing it when there aren’t others around, so try to find a place & time where that will work. It might be that you do it in the bathroom if necessary. If you can’t find that in your home, find a park or beach, but make sure it’s close by so you have no excuse for not doing it."
How do you start creating the habit?,"Start small, just 2 minutes a day. Pick a trigger that’s in your daily routine, and do it immediately after. Do it every day for a month. Enjoy the habit, and focus on how much you love it. Commit publicly. Use the accountability teams in the forum to motivate yourself."
Do you need your eyes shut for it?,"You can close your eyes. I recommend that your eyes be open, with your lids about half closed, with a soft focus on the ground a few feet in front of you. This, however, is a detail that is not incredibly important."
How to start focusing — I just can’t grasp “sitting for X minutes/hrs”.,"You get better with practice. Just start for 2 minutes, and increase each week if you’re successful that week. Pay attention to your breath, as it comes in and goes out. Don’t worry so much about “focusing” … you’ll get better at it. See next question. Also, don’t worry so much about the time — just start, and don’t worry about how long it will take. The length is not as important as doing it."
How does one stop the mind from wandering?,"Don’t worry about stopping the mind from wandering. Focus on your breath as it comes in and goes out. You can count breaths, one in and two out, three in and four out, to help you focus. Observe your thoughts as they wander — and they will. Don’t be bothered by this wandering — it’s natural. Just notice it, and gently return to the breath. You’ll get better with practice."
"About space, which place is better when you’re in a tight space with more people?","On your bed, in the bathroom, in the kitchen or living room when everyone is asleep. Or go outside to a park or beach that’s nearby. Not too far."
How can I do meditation on the go?,"I’d recommend starting with sitting meditation, at home or near your home, but eventually practice doing it on the go. On a train is great. In the car, it’s best to focus on your driving and the surroundings, which can be a form of meditation. Go for walks, and pay attention to your breathing, your thoughts, your steps, the ground in front of you."
How do you set reasonable expectations for what the experience of meditation will be like?,"Don’t have any expectations. Just go in with a “let’s see what happens” attitude. Experience the meditation, and pay attention to it, but don’t ask it to meet your expectations."
"My meditation problem is: I can’t do it with the kids around but after they’re in bed or if I get up early, I often fall asleep.","That’s OK. Get up just 10-20 minutes early, and just get started. If you’re sitting up (as opposed to lying down), it’ll be easier to stay awake. Keep your eyes open but with soft focus. If you fall asleep, just do it again the next day. You’ll get used to it."
How do I keep the habit of meditation up?,"Starting small (5 minutes a day) is a great way to get started, but it’s also a great way to keep things going. It’s hard to do a 30- or 60-minute habit for a month, but it’s much easier to do 5 minutes a day for an entire month. Committing publicly (announce it on Facebook, Twitter, blog, G+), and doing it with a group helps keep the motivation going."
How to approach it from a non-religious point of view?,"Meditation is simply mindfulness practice — you’re learning to live presently, mindfully. It can be a spiritual practice, but as we’re doing it here on Zen Habits, it’s simply sitting and being mindful."
"How critical is the sitting posture (i.e. hands, feet, etc)?","It’s not that important. Zen meditation has certain forms that are recommended, but I don’t ask you to follow these exactly. Just sit, and pay attention to your breath. You can sit wherever is comfortable, in whatever form is comfortable. For example, I am very inflexible, so I sit with my back against the wall and in a not-very-cross-legged style. That works for me."
